# Azure AD B2C HTML templates

In Azure AD B2C, you can craft your users' identity experiences so that the pages they're shown blend seamlessly with the look and feel of your brand. You get nearly full control of the HTML and CSS content presented to your users when they proceed through your application's identity journeys. With this flexibility, you can maintain brand and visual consistency between your application and Azure AD B2C.
